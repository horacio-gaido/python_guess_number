# Python Guessing Game

## Getting Started
This is a simple guessing game implemented in Python. The user has to guess a secret number between 1 and 100 in as few attempts as possible.


### Prerequisites
To run this game, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system.
- Python 3

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/horacio-gaido/python_guess_number.git
```

## Running the code
To run the game, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository. Then, enter the following command:
```sh
py guess_number.py
```

The code can be run by calling the play_game() function which runs the game logic. The code also uses the os module to clear the console after each guess, making the output easier to read. The code is compatible with Python 3.
The game will start and prompt you to enter a number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the game will give you a hint whether the secret number is higher or lower than your guess. Once you guess the secret number, the game will print a congratulatory message and show you the number of attempts it took you to guess the number.
